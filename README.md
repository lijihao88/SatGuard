# Supplementary data of SatGuard 
The data includes recorded packet loss rate in each time slot (1 second) of 800Mbps UDP traffic without and with SatGuard. There is a continuous 5% packet loss rate in the path and a handover occurs every 15 seconds in this experiment.
A negative number indicates that the packets were lost at the end of the previous time slot and recovered in the next time slot.
